//  The euclid class has 3 functions. Function gcd finds the greatest common divisor between two numbers in its parameter
//  and returns the gcd from those two numbers and increments whenever the modulus oeprator is used.
//  The other functions are set and get ModOperator. Thse are used to get the number of modulus operations were used. These
//  functions are used in order to not make a global variable in the main function.

 @ param A and B are integers

 The gcd function will go through integers A and B and will do it as long as B is not zero. It will return
 the other number if one of them is zero. If both numbers are not zero then it will do the calculations 
 and do the modulus operations.
